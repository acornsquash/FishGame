Welcome to fish game!!

Inspired by Neko Atsume's Kitty Collector, this aim of this project is to create a simple, feel-good game that gives the player a moment of joy and surprise in their day. Decorate your corner of sea floor with corals, sea plants, and maybe some pretty rocks and check back later to see the delightful creatures that have been drawn to your space.
